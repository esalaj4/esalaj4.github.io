                Jamie Adeyemi is a Radiant hailing from the Peckham district in London, England. 
                Growing up, Adeyemi attended a Performing Arts school in the area but was later suspended. 
                Recruited into the VALORANT Protocol as its ninth agent, "Phoenix", 
                Adeyemi was heavily involved with the Protocol's activities from 10 AFL onwards. 
                With much information kept from him as need-to-know as a recent recruit, he was unable to prevent a spike detonation in Venice 
                whilst on a solo mission.

                Phoenix was given another opportunity to stop one the next day when another attack occurred in Rabat, 
                and it was here that he first came face-to-face with the sole perpetrator, his own Omega counterpart.
